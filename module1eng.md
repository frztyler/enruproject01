1.1.1 The Evolution of Digital Transformation

Tell the truth …. how many of you could actually make it through a day without your smartphone?

In our world today, there are more smart devices than there are people. A growing number of people are connected to the internet, in one way or another, 24 hours a day. An ever-increasing number of people have, and rely on, three, four, or more smart devices. These might include smartphones, exercise and health monitors, e-readers, and tablets. It is forecast that on average, there will be 3.4 smart devices or connections for every person on earth.

The IoT is relevant to many industries. IoT systems contribute to the environmental controls, retail, transportation, healthcare, and agriculture industries among many others. According to Statista, the number of IoT devices that are in use across all relevant industries is forecast to grow to more than eight billion by 2030. As for consumers, important areas of growth are internet and digital media devices, which includes smartphones. This area is also predicted to grow to more than eight billion by 2030. Other applications with more than one million connected devices are connected and autonomous vehicles, IT infrastructure, asset management, and electric utility smart grid.

How is it possible for so many devices to be connected?

Modern digital networks make all this possible. The world is quickly being covered with networks that allow digital devices to interconnect and transmit. Think of the mesh of networks like a digital skin surrounding the planet. With this digital skin, mobile devices, electronic sensors, electronic measuring devices, medical devices, and gauges are all able to connect. They monitor, communicate, evaluate, and in some cases automatically adjust to the data that is being collected and transmitted.

As society embraces these digital devices, as digital networks continue to grow around the world, and as the economic benefits of digitization continue to grow, we are seeing a digital transformation. Digital transformation is the application of digital technology to provide the stage for business and industry to innovate. This digital innovation is now being applied to every aspect of human society.

It is important to understand that most people born since the 1990s, will have grown up in a primarily digital world. This survey will help you to recognize how much of the day is actually spent “connected”. This will help us to see the impact this generation will have on business and the economy.

Smart Home Automation

Digital Technology has enabled business to innovate their approach to interacting with society. People from all generations are more comfortable with digital technology and are using smart devices to their advantage throughout their busy days.

Smart Buildings

Many companies now provide some or all of their services on-line. From the comfort of your home, car, gym, or office, you can shop for groceries on-line, order restaurant meals to be delivered to your door, book travel on-line, order clothes, camping gear, taxis, stay connected to friends, or meet a new love interest.

Sensors are everywhere generating massive amounts of data.

Smart homes can be equipped with motion sensors, water sensors, light sensors, doorbell sensors, and temperature sensors. There can be sensors in traffic lights, transport trucks, parking garages, security cameras, trains, and planes. All of these sensors and measuring devices collect and transmit their data. The data can be stored and analyzed at a later date or it can be analyzed immediately to be used to modify computers, mobile devices, or processes of any sort.

How is the stored and analyzed data used?
Cities control traffic, monitor parking, provide police or fire support quicker, and control waste management.


1.1.4 Can Smart Devices Think?

All digital devices work based on computer programs and supplied data. Artificial Intelligence implies that these devices are able to think on their own. If programmed appropriately, smart devices are able to evaluate data that is provided to them and modify processes or settings “on the fly”. If they are provided with sufficient data, they can “learn” and modify their own code based on the new parameters.
Imagine a refrigerated transport truck, carrying frozen goods, that is equipped with a global positioning sensor. As the truck drives into a major city, the sensor determines that there is an accident ahead that is causing major traffic congestion. The sensor sends the data to the computer system that collects the data and make decisions. The system then alerts the driver to the new conditions so that the accident can be bypassed. This automatic interaction has saved the driver time and will get the transported product to market faster with a product that is still frozen.
Corporate offices can be occupied by thousands of employees. Keeping the environment, such as lighting, heat, humidity, in the building within acceptable parameters helps to keep employees happy and therefore more productive.

Smart Cities, such as Barcelona, Spain, use sensors to control many of their infrastructure systems such as traffic flow, parking, water utilization, and hydro.

Example 1: Weight sensors in parking spaces allow drivers to quickly know where there is an available parking spot. This reduces driving and idling time for the driver and lowers carbon emissions for the environment.

Example 2: Sensors on traffic lights can detect traffic congestion. This data is sent to the computer system that collects data and make decisions. The new decisions are sent to actuators that modify red versus green light times to assist the flow of traffic. This also alleviates idling but also reduces driver frustration and accidents.

Self-driving cars are revolutionizing transportation. The cars are equipped with many ultrasound sensors, cameras, precision GPSs, and computers. The combination of the on-board equipment allows the computers to identify, other cars, lanes, pedestrians, and obstructions. This information allows the car to stay in its lane, stop when required, and weave around obstructions.

Some of the manufacturers in the "autonomous car" market are Tesla Motors, General Motors, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz. Corporations such as Waymo, Google's sibling, and Uber are also designing and testing the technology.

The road to complete autonomy using this technology is complicated. There have been many high profile crashes and some serious accidents involving self-driving cars. Some states within the USA have already approved limited use of self-driving cars but researchers believe it will be a few years before the technology becomes mainstream.

Once the technology is proven, what is next? Self-driving trucks? Airplanes? Trains?
